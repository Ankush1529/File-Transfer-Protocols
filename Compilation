Compile the java codes starting with the server side(as in this case filerec.java) and then the client side(this case filetran.java)
As there is no data loss(no use of probability function) and no error checking,there is no function to resend the data packets.
filetra.java is a serializable class of filetran.java and demo.java is a serializable class of filerec.java
